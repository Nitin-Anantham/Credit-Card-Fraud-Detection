# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project demonstrates a machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection), and includes a robust workflow for preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and training the model.

## **Steps to Run the Project**

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - You can either:
     - **Download and upload the Colab file manually**: Download `Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.ipynb` from this repository and upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
     - **Open directly via link**: Use [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oeu32JUUpa4VHXOtTscfGVKZOYDiCxA2?usp=sharing) to open the notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Visit [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
   - Download the dataset as a `.zip` file (e.g., `dataset.zip`) to your local machine.

3. **Upload the Dataset**:
   - Run the **first cell** in the Colab notebook. It will prompt you to upload the `.zip` file.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute all the code cells in sequence to preprocess the data, train the Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate its performance.
